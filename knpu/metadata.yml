title:  Dependency Injection and the art of services and containers
length: 22:45
summary: |
    Get your object-oriented skills sharp by exploring the ideas and reasons
    behind dependency injection. This simple principle separates developers
    who write functional code from those that are able to build great, and
    maintanable applications. In this tutorial, we'll see dependency injection
    in action, why it's important, and how it relates to services and service-oriented
    architecture. We'll also refactor our application to use a dependency
    injection container, using a fantastic - but simple - container called
    Pimple.
    
    If you're ready to take your object-oriented code to the next level, AND
    actually be excited about doing it, this tutorial is for you!
